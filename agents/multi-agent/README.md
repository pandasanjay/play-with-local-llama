# Multi-Agent Systems

This directory contains examples of multi-agent systems where several specialized AI agents work together to solve complex problems.

## What is a Multi-Agent System?

A multi-agent system consists of multiple AI agents, each with specific capabilities and responsibilities, that collaborate to accomplish tasks that would be difficult for a single agent. This approach has several advantages:

1. **Specialization**: Each agent can focus on what it does best
2. **Scalability**: New agents can be added to handle additional tasks
3. **Robustness**: If one agent fails, others can continue functioning
4. **Divide and Conquer**: Complex problems can be broken down into manageable parts

## Example: Structured Output Multi-Agent System

The `multi-agent-strctured_out.py` file demonstrates a comprehensive multi-agent system with:

- **Triaging Agent**: Routes user queries to the appropriate specialized agents
- **Data Processing Agent**: Cleans, transforms, and aggregates data
- **Analysis Agent**: Performs statistical, correlation, and regression analysis
- **Visualization Agent**: Creates different types of charts and visualizations

### System Architecture

1. **User Input**: The system receives a query from the user
2. **Triage**: The triaging agent analyzes the query and routes it to appropriate agents
3. **Parallel Processing**: Multiple agents work on different aspects of the problem
4. **Result Aggregation**: The results from all agents are combined into a coherent response
5. **User Feedback**: The system presents the results to the user

### Key Technical Components

- **Agent Communication**: How agents exchange information
- **Tool Integration**: How agents use external functions
- **Task Decomposition**: How complex tasks are broken down
- **Result Synthesis**: How partial results are combined

## How to Run the Example

```python
# Make sure you have the required dependencies installed
# Run the multi-agent system with a sample query
python multi-agent-strctured_out.py
```

## Extending the System

You can extend this multi-agent system in several ways:

1. **Add New Agents**: Create agents with new specialties
2. **Enhance Existing Agents**: Add more capabilities to current agents
3. **Improve Coordination**: Refine how agents work together
4. **Add Memory**: Implement persistent memory across conversations

## Learning Objectives

By studying this example, you should be able to understand:

1. How to design agent roles and responsibilities
2. How to implement communication between agents
3. How to handle task routing and delegation
4. How to aggregate results from multiple agents
