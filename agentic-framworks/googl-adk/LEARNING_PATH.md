  - Implement a root agent with multiple specialized sub-agents
  - Test different delegation strategies

- [ ] **Agent Team Project**
  - Design a multi-agent system for a specific use case
  - Implement specialized agents with distinct responsibilities
  - Test inter-agent communication and coordination

### Phase 4: Workflow Agents (Week 4)
- [ ] **Sequential Agents**
  - Study the [Sequential Agent documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/sequential-agents/)
  - Implement a basic sequential workflow
  - Add error handling and recovery logic

- [ ] **Loop Agents**
  - Study the [Loop Agent documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/)
  - Implement a loop-based workflow
  - Practice exit condition design

- [ ] **Parallel Agents**
  - Study the [Parallel Agent documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/parallel-agents/)
  - Implement parallel task execution

### Phase 5: MCP & Advanced Features (Week 5)
- [ ] **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**
  - Study the [MCP documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/mcp/)
  - Understand client-server architecture for MCP
  - Implement a basic MCP server

- [ ] **Safety & Security**
  - Implement callback patterns for safety:
    - before_model_callback
    - before_tool_callback
  - Add input and output validation

- [ ] **Deployment Strategies**
  - Explore deployment options:
    - Agent Engine
    - Cloud Run
    - Custom infrastructure

### Phase 6: Final Project (Week 6)
- [ ] **Comprehensive Multi-Agent System**
  - Design a complex system that combines:
    - Multiple specialized agents
    - Workflow agents for structured processes
    - MCP for model interaction
    - State management for persistent memory
    - Safety callbacks for guardrails

- [ ] **Evaluation & Optimization**
  - Test system with diverse inputs
  - Measure performance and accuracy
  - Optimize prompts and agent instructions

- [ ] **Documentation & Reflection**
  - Document architecture decisions
  - Identify challenges and solutions
  - Plan next steps for enhancement
